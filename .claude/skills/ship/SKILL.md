# Ship

End-of-session routine to verify, document, commit, and push all changes.

## Steps

### 1. Quality checks

Run these in sequence — stop if any fail:

```bash
npm run format:check
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run test
npm run build
```

All five must pass with zero errors. Do NOT skip or reorder.

### 2. Update documentation

Check if any of these files need updates based on what changed this session:

- **`docs/log/<version>-<feature>.md`** — If a feature shipped this session, this log **must** exist. Create it if it doesn't. Include: what was built, key decisions, files changed, gotchas for future sessions.
- **`docs/INDEX.md`** — Shipped features table and "next up" status. Update if features were shipped.
- **`docs/plan/phase-1.md`** — Active roadmap. Mark completed items.
- **`CLAUDE.md`** — Architecture, key patterns, important rules. Update if new files, patterns, or conventions were added.
- **`README.md`** — User-facing docs. Update if features, setup steps, or project structure changed.
- **`docs/reference/audit.md`** — Bug tracking. Update if bugs were found and fixed.

Only update what actually changed. But always check `docs/log/` — a missing log for a shipped feature is a documentation debt.

### 3. Bump service worker cache version

If any code in `src/` or `public/` changed, bump the `CACHE_NAME` version in `public/sw.js`. Follow semver:
- Patch (x.x.+1) for bug fixes
- Minor (x.+1.0) for new features
- Major (+1.0.0) for breaking changes

### 4. Commit

- Stage specific files (never `git add -A` or `git add .`)
- Use conventional commit format:
  - `feat:` new feature
  - `fix:` bug fix
  - `refactor:` code restructuring
  - `chore:` tooling, deps, config
  - `docs:` documentation only
  - `test:` tests only
- End with `Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>`
- Use HEREDOC format for the message

### 5. Push

```bash
git push -u origin <current-branch>
```

### 6. Confirm

Show a summary table of what was shipped:
- Branch name
- Files changed (count)
- Commit hash + message
- Docs updated (which ones)
- Log created/updated (which file)
- All 5 quality checks: PASS/FAIL
